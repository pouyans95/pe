## About Project Euler

Project Euler is a series of challenging mathematical/computer programming problems that require more than just mathematical insights to solve. The problems are designed to be solved with the help of a computer, and they often involve more than just mathematical calculations. They require creativity and problem-solving skills.

Visit the [official Project Euler website](https://projecteuler.net/) to learn more and start solving problems.

## Solutions

Here you can find my solutions to various Project Euler problems. Each problem has its own folder, for example, `problem1`, containing at least two files:

- `solution.py`: Provides the solution to the problem.
- `README.md`: Elaborates on the problem statement.

The directory structure is as follows:

/problem-001
solution.py
README.md
/problem-002
solution.py
README.md
...


Feel free to explore the solutions and learn from them. Keep in mind that one of the goals of Project Euler is to learn and improve your programming and problem-solving skills.

## Usage

To run a specific solution, navigate to the corresponding directory and follow the instructions provided in the README or comments within the code. Make sure you have the necessary runtime or interpreter installed for the chosen programming language.

## Contributing

If you'd like to contribute your own solutions, feel free to submit a pull request. Please adhere to the following guidelines:

1. Each solution should be in its own directory named `problemXXX` where XXX is the problem number.
2. Include a README in each solution directory explaining the problem and providing any relevant information about your solution.
3. Clearly state the programming language used in your solution.
4. Ensure your code is well-documented and follows best practices.

## License

This repository is licensed under the [MIT License](LICENSE), which means you are free to use, modify, and distribute the code for personal or commercial purposes.

Happy coding!
