# Problem 2: Even Fibonacci Numbers

## Problem Statement

Each new term in the Fibonacci sequence is generated by adding the previous two terms. By starting with 1 and 2, the first 10 terms will be: 1, 2, 3, 5, 8, 13, 21, 34, 55, 89, ...

By considering the terms in the Fibonacci sequence whose values do not exceed four million, find the sum of the even-valued terms.

## Solution

The solution to this problem is implemented in the `solution.py` file. The program generates the Fibonacci sequence and calculates the sum of the even-valued terms below four million. The result is printed to the console.

### Memoization Technique

In the `fibonacci` function, a memoization dictionary (`memo`) is employed to store previously calculated Fibonacci numbers. This technique helps avoid redundant calculations by checking if the Fibonacci number for a specific index is already computed before recalculating it.


## How to Run

To execute the solution, run the following command:

```bash
python solution.py
